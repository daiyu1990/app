These\n    functions are mutually exclusive.  Use ajaxSubmit if you want\n    to bind your own submit handler to the form.  For example,\n\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('#myForm').on('submit', function(e) {\n            e.preventDefault(); // <-- important\n            $(this).ajaxSubmit({\n                target: '#output'\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n    Use ajaxForm when you want the plugin to manage all the event binding\n    for you.  For example,\n\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('#myForm').ajaxForm({\n            target: '#output'\n        });\n    });\n\n    You can also use ajaxForm with delegation (requires jQuery v1.7+), so the\n    form does not have to exist when you invoke ajaxForm:\n\n    $('#myForm').ajaxForm({\n        delegation: true,\n        target: '#output'\n    });\n\n    When using ajaxForm, the ajaxSubmit function will be invoked for you\n    at the appropriate time.\n*/\n\n/**\n * Feature detection\n */\nvar feature = {};\nfeature.fileapi = $(\"<input type='file'/>\").get(0).files !== undefined;\nfeature.formdata = window.FormData !== undefined;\n\nvar hasProp = !!$.fn.prop;\n\n// attr2 uses prop when it can but checks the return type for\n// an expected string.  this accounts for the case where a form \n// contains inputs with names like \"action\" or \"method\"; in those\n// cases \"prop\" returns the element\n$.fn.attr2 = function() {\n    if ( ! hasProp ) {\n        return this.attr.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n    var val = this.prop.apply(this, arguments);\n    if ( ( val && val.jquery ) || typeof val === 'string' ) {\n        return val;\n    }\n    return this.attr.apply(this, arguments);\n};\n\n/**\n * ajaxSubmit() provides a mechanism for immediately submitting\n * an HTML form using AJAX.\n */\n$.fn.ajaxSubmit = function(options) {\n    /*jshint scripturl:true */\n\n    // fast fail if nothing selected (http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/2752)\n    if (!this.length) {\n        log('ajaxSubmit: skipping submit process - no element selected');\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    var method, action, url, $form = this;\n\n    if (typeof options == 'function') {\n        options = { success: options };\n    }\n    else if ( options === undefined ) {\n        options = {};\n    }\n\n    method = options.type || this.attr2('method');\n    action = options.url  || this.attr2('action');\n\n    url = (typeof action === 'string') ? $.trim(action) : '';\n    url = url || window.location.href || '';\n    if (url) {\n        // clean url (don't include hash vaue)\n        url = (url.match(/^([^#]+)/)||[])[1];\n    }\n\n    options = $.extend(true, {\n        url:  url,\n        success: $.ajaxSettings.success,\n        type: method || $.ajaxSettings.type,\n        iframeSrc: /^https/i.test(window.location.href || '') ?

These\n    functions are mutually exclusive.  Use ajaxSubmit if you want\n    to bind your own submit handler to the form.  For example,\n\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('#myForm').on('submit', function(e) {\n            e.preventDefault(); // <-- important\n            $(this).ajaxSubmit({\n                target: '#output'\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n    Use ajaxForm when you want the plugin to manage all the event binding\n    for you.  For example,\n\n    $(document).ready(function() {\n        $('#myForm').ajaxForm({\n            target: '#output'\n        });\n    });\n\n    You can also use ajaxForm with delegation (requires jQuery v1.7+), so the\n    form does not have to exist when you invoke ajaxForm:\n\n    $('#myForm').ajaxForm({\n        delegation: true,\n        target: '#output'\n    });\n\n    When using ajaxForm, the ajaxSubmit function will be invoked for you\n    at the appropriate time.\n*/\n\n/**\n * Feature detection\n */\nvar feature = {};\nfeature.fileapi = $(\"<input type='file'/>\").get(0).files !== undefined;\nfeature.formdata = window.FormData !== undefined;\n\nvar hasProp = !!$.fn.prop;\n\n// attr2 uses prop when it can but checks the return type for\n// an expected string.  this accounts for the case where a form \n// contains inputs with names like \"action\" or \"method\"; in those\n// cases \"prop\" returns the element\n$.fn.attr2 = function() {\n    if ( ! hasProp ) {\n        return this.attr.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n    var val = this.prop.apply(this, arguments);\n    if ( ( val && val.jquery ) || typeof val === 'string' ) {\n        return val;\n    }\n    return this.attr.apply(this, arguments);\n};\n\n/**\n * ajaxSubmit() provides a mechanism for immediately submitting\n * an HTML form using AJAX.\n */\n$.fn.ajaxSubmit = function(options) {\n    /*jshint scripturl:true */\n\n    // fast fail if nothing selected (http://dev.jquery.com/ticket/2752)\n    if (!this.length) {\n        log('ajaxSubmit: skipping submit process - no element selected');\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    var method, action, url, $form = this;\n\n    if (typeof options == 'function') {\n        options = { success: options };\n    }\n    else if ( options === undefined ) {\n        options = {};\n    }\n\n    method = options.type || this.attr2('method');\n    action = options.url  || this.attr2('action');\n\n    url = (typeof action === 'string') ? $.trim(action) : '';\n    url = url || window.location.href || '';\n    if (url) {\n        // clean url (don't include hash vaue)\n        url = (url.match(/^([^#]+)/)||[])[1];\n    }\n\n    options = $.extend(true, {\n        url:  url,\n        success: $.ajaxSettings.success,\n        type: method || $.ajaxSettings.type,\n        iframeSrc: /^https/i.test(window.location.href || '') ?
